What is the serial number that corresponds to your last name? You may capitalize
the first letter or leave them all lower case, whichever you find easier. If
your last name is not at least 5 letters long, you will repeat it until it
reaches 5 letters. Example: last name Xu would be entered as Xuxux or xuxux.
